    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>My main goal is to deliver high quality websites that help small and medium-sized businesses get the most out of their online presence optimizing websites for small and medium screens such as iPhones, iPads, android devices and retina displays</p>

    <p>Currently I'm available for hire as a freelancer for new projects. When not coding I can be found at Starbucks with my iPad reading a book or at the local gym. I also organize Stamford WordPress meetup, give presentations at this and other local meetups on different web development topics.</p>

    <p>I design and develop websites for over 6 years. Most of them I built using WordPress CMS, which is the most used content management system in the world. Every website is tailored to client needs and created from scratch without using any templates.</p>

    <p>I developed websites for bigger companies as part of a team, if you need examples of those websites - drop me a line</p>
