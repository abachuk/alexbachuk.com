    <h1>About me</h1>
    {/* <p>I started building websites back in 2007 with plain HTML, CSS and some jQuery.</p>
      
    <p>It didn't take long before I discovered WordPress and switched to using the framework exclusevly for 5 years. When I started learning WordPress, there were no user groups or meetups in the Stamford CT area. So, I started one. That's how I met many of the like-minded people and made some friends. In addition to organizing meetups, I presented and tought WordPress locally and NYC.</p>

    <p>When WordPress</p> */}
    <p>Currently, I'm working as a Director of Front end development and Web UX at Priceline.com. I'm focused primariliy on maintaining and building React and Angular codebases on front end, Node.js and GraphQL on the server.</p>

    <p>In the past I was involved in few startups as well as building my own products on the side. I started and was organizer of WordPress meetup group in Stamford CT for few years until I moved on completely to JavaScript and Node.js.</p>

    <p>These days I'm one of the organizers of GraphQL NYC and Meteor.js NYC meetup groups. I often attend or speak at various meetups in New York and Connecticut.</p>
