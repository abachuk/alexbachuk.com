After upgrading to Monutain Lion – Java wasn’t working in web browsers by default. Apple switched to software updates in App Store.

So to install / update Java, open terminal and type `/Applications/Utilities/Java Preferences.app/Contents/MacOS/Java Preferences` You should see dialog box with install button\n\n![](http://alexbachuk.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Java-Preferences.jpg \"Java Preferences\")

Don’t forget to restart the browser.
