[jQuery mobile](http://alexbachuk.com/jquery-mobile-basics/ \"jQuery Mobile basics\") contains several pages in DOM at once to make page transition smooth and fast, and also pre-caching static pages. If you need to get current URL, and decided to use

`window.location.href` â€“ it will return previous page URL, because active page is inserted into the DOM via AJAX.
To get current page URL use `$.mobile.activePage[0].baseURI`
