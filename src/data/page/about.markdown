### About page coming soon

My main goal is to deliver high quality websites that help small and medium-sized businesses get the most out of their online presence optimizing websites for small and medium screens such as iPhones, iPads, android devices and retina displays

Currently I'm available for hire as a freelancer for new projects. When not coding I can be found at Starbucks with my iPad reading a book or at the local gym. I also organize Stamford WordPress meetup, give presentations at this and other local meetups on different web development topics.

I design and develop websites for over 6 years. Most of them I built using WordPress CMS, which is the most used content management system in the world. Every website is tailored to client needs and created from scratch without using any templates.

I developed websites for bigger companies as part of a team, if you need examples of those websites - drop me a line
