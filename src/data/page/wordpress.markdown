## WordPress is the most popular CMS in the world

WordPress is my preferred content management system, because it’s very flexible, has user-friendly dashboard, extendable with free and premium plugins and secure. WordPress is the most popular publishing platform in the world and currently powers over [60 million websites](http://www.forbes.com/sites/jjcolao/2012/09/05/the-internets-mother-tongue/) of websites including some Fortune500 companies. It’s an open source platform, which means you don’t have to pay any license fees for the core software and there are few thousand plugins and themes available on the Internet. The main advantage of using WordPress is that it’s easy to maintain and makes editing text, images and other content on your website very intuitive and easy. Having a WordPress based website gives you ability to extend it anytime to E-Commerce, blog, online forum, photo gallery or membership protected website.

I design and build custom WordPress websites, specifically suited for client’s needs and make sure they’re search engine optimized and secure. If you plan to build a website or even web app - I would recommend WordPress in most cases (there are some limitations also). After a website is built I take time to teach client how to maintain and update the website. And I’m always available to answer any WordPress related questions. Sometimes I give presentations and share my knowledge with users and developers.
