      <description>WordPress is the most popular CMS in the world WordPress is my preferred content management system, because it’s very flexible, has user-friendly dashboard, extendable with free and premium plugins and secure. WordPress is the most popular publishing platform in the world and currently powers over 60 million websites of websites including some Fortune500 companies. It’s an open source platform, which means you don’t have to pay any license fees for the core software and there are few thousand plugins and themes available on the Internet.</description>
