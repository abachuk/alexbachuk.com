      <description>Many website owners face the similar challenges sooner or later. Where my website is hosted, who is my domain registrar, do I have any backups, etc. It’s very easy to forget logins, passwords, and all related information to your website mechanics (what’s under the hood).
The reason why this is happening is many people focus on their business only rather than website, very few have dedicated “website guy” who takes care of all the logistics.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve built simple Rails application. Then I decided to move it to &amp;ldquo;interwebs&amp;rdquo; and make it live. But&amp;hellip; it wasnt&amp;rsquo; as straigtforward as I thought. Even though there are gazilion tutorials - it just didn&amp;rsquo;t work. After about work of struggle - finally I figured it out. Here is step by step instruction that worked for me, I borrowed different steps from different tutorials. My stack is Linux, Nginx, Passenger, Ruby 2, Rails 4, MySQL, Node.</description>
