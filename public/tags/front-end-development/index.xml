      <description>The average website load time is 2.45 seconds, according to Google Analytics blog, posted in 2012. http://analytics.blogspot.com/2012/04/global-site-speed-overview-how-fast-are.html. Users are increasingly becoming more impatient, they expect a page to load fast. Especially mobile users, who are mostly on the go and need to access the information fast. Companies like amazon and google invest a lot of effort and have dedicated teams who work on improving not only their websites but helping others to do the same with their websites.</description>

      <description>Backbone.js is&amp;hellip; as some say - just another javascript plugin. And technically it is just 6KB javascript plugin that you can add to pretty much any website or web application, it&amp;rsquo;s MV* library, not a framework. There are not strict rules, developer has freedom to choose their own style of writing an app, for better or worse :)
Some background: I&amp;rsquo;ve built few web applications with Backbone.js, and I don&amp;rsquo;t have any experience with any other MV* javascript library or framework, so it&amp;rsquo;s hard for me to compare.</description>

      <description>My day job is front end web developer. That means I write JavaScript, HTML and CSS every single day (in that order). Front end development is not about static html pages anymore and JavaScript is not just for animations. It&amp;rsquo;s much more than that. You can build any web application with these open source technologies, including on the server side (Node.js).
In this space web browsers are the ones who dictate how we, as developers, can utilize latest and greatest tricks, CSS3 animations and layout syntax (flexbox, columns), HTML5 APIs(localstorage, geolocation), JavaScript methods(map, pluck).</description>
