      <description>This was my first web development conference that’s not WordCamp. I started developing with JavaScript quite recently, before that I was using jQuery to manipulate DOM and use others plugins (which works for small websites pretty well). Since it was not that far from New York City - I decided to attend and see what’s new in jQuery world (especially after I saw Paul Irish and Addy Osmani among other speakers).</description>

      <description>jQuery Mobile is touch friendly and AJAX powered framework which was built by jQuery team.
It is a great framework for building mobile websites or apps and if combine it with responsive design - it becomes even better. Nowadays everyone knows that the best way to build a website is responsive way, a “write once, run everywhere” style.
jQuery mobile uses AJAX for page loading and provides flexible theming tool - theme roller, default theme is very iOS-like, but it&amp;rsquo;s very easy to change just changing default CSS.</description>
