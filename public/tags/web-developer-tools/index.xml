      <description>The average website load time is 2.45 seconds, according to Google Analytics blog, posted in 2012. http://analytics.blogspot.com/2012/04/global-site-speed-overview-how-fast-are.html. Users are increasingly becoming more impatient, they expect a page to load fast. Especially mobile users, who are mostly on the go and need to access the information fast. Companies like amazon and google invest a lot of effort and have dedicated teams who work on improving not only their websites but helping others to do the same with their websites.</description>

      <description>My day job is front end web developer. That means I write JavaScript, HTML and CSS every single day (in that order). Front end development is not about static html pages anymore and JavaScript is not just for animations. It&amp;rsquo;s much more than that. You can build any web application with these open source technologies, including on the server side (Node.js).
In this space web browsers are the ones who dictate how we, as developers, can utilize latest and greatest tricks, CSS3 animations and layout syntax (flexbox, columns), HTML5 APIs(localstorage, geolocation), JavaScript methods(map, pluck).</description>

      <description>When developing websites for clients I always try to make everything as transparent as possible. And for that reason I set up staging environment on my web server, something like separate folder and point the client to that URL while I develop the website, so they can keep track of all the changes and we can communicate better.
Until few months ago this approach was 100% ok with me, I just developed directly on remote server via FTP (my coda editor is perfect for that), but then I started to notice new cool stuff popping up almost every few months or weeks.</description>

      <description>Recently I started learning ruby on rails. And unlike other languages everything happens mostly in terminal, so next thing I know - I have to use command line now. I tried few tutorials here and there but couldn&amp;rsquo;t find anything that explained how to properly install ruby and rails step by step, something for ruby beginners. So, I wrote my process here. I&amp;rsquo;m using mac and ruby 1.8.7 is pre-installed with Mac OS 10.</description>
