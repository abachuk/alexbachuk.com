      <description>This was my first web development conference that’s not WordCamp. I started developing with JavaScript quite recently, before that I was using jQuery to manipulate DOM and use others plugins (which works for small websites pretty well). Since it was not that far from New York City - I decided to attend and see what’s new in jQuery world (especially after I saw Paul Irish and Addy Osmani among other speakers).</description>
