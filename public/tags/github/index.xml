      <description>While working with other freelancers on a couple of projects we were having a hard time exchanging the code and collaborating efficiently. Making changes on live or staging server via FTP is fast and great, but there is one big problem with that - we overwrite each others changes. Or if I work alone on a project - I just can&amp;rsquo;t keep track of what was done and exactly what file I changed last time.</description>
