      <description>TL;DR: Packtpub was kind enough to give me 2 digital copies to give away to my readers. Please leave a comment below, add a sentence or two what app you&amp;rsquo;re working on or why you&amp;rsquo;d like to win this book. I&amp;rsquo;ll pick 2 winners on July 12th.
WordPress has come along way from being just a blogging platform to becoming a full-featured CMS site. It is now even being used as a platform for web and mobile applications.</description>
