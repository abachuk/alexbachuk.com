      <description>WordPress is an excellent CMS and provides a lot of flexibility for developers, users, authors, and everyone who manages websites.
I wrote a blog post phonegap few months ago and few people were interested to learn more how to use WordPress as a backend for a mobile app. Phonegap is just one of the tools you can build a mobile app. WordPress is, in this case, API server, it manages database and all the content stored in there.</description>
