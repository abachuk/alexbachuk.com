      <description>Yeoman is a great tool for web app development. It provides all necessary components for building any web application the right way, including web server. Web server is connect middleware as grunt task, comes also with live reload, which makes front end development super convenient. So, this set up is pretty awesome, but&amp;hellip;
The Problem The sever is running on localhost:9000 by default, I have tried changing URL to match my own local domain names, so I can call API and avoid cross domain restrictions.</description>

      <description>WordPress is an excellent CMS and provides a lot of flexibility for developers, users, authors, and everyone who manages websites.
I wrote a blog post phonegap few months ago and few people were interested to learn more how to use WordPress as a backend for a mobile app. Phonegap is just one of the tools you can build a mobile app. WordPress is, in this case, API server, it manages database and all the content stored in there.</description>
