      <description>WordPress is my CMS of choice. Every single project I do is very different from the previous one. And not only on the front-end, but on the back-end as well. It&amp;rsquo;s not just static pages and blog, WordPress can do a lot more. But what if you build a project for a client and besides making it look great with CSS, JavaScript animations and making responsive - you also have to make it easy to manage, edit and maintain, what if client is not a web developer?</description>

      <description>As a WordPress expert I almost always try to convince or at least recommend it for any project I do, either it&amp;rsquo;s small website for business around the corner or startup trying to get off the ground and build minimum viable product, although WordPress is not ultimate solution for any web appÂ out there - it can do a lot of stuff, after all it&amp;rsquo;s just php files and mysql database, so it can do anything php can do&amp;hellip; and it can do a lot.</description>

      <title>My experience with HTML Email development</title>

      <description>I started doing web development around 2008, at that time HTML tables became obsolete and a lot of web developers were advocating for web standards. And as a good practice, I started learning web development the right way, divs and css instead of tables in inline styles.
In my career I never had to do HTML emails and when clients asked me to make nice HTML email templates - I either outsourced it or directed them to one of the marketplaces to pick pre-made template and then changed a few thing here and there.</description>
