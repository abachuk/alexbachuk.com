      <description>I had a chance to attend one of the Angular.js meetups. Google hosts the meetup in its New York Chelsea market office. This time it was a hack night, few googlers were there, some other smart people. We broke into few groups and were discussing various things (protractor.js, mean stack, node.js and angular bugs in general).
I was surprised how many people were interested in MEAN (MongoDB, Express.js, Angular.js, Node.js) stack, which is full stack written 100% in JavaScript.</description>
