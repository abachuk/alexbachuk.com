      <description>I started doing web development around 2008, at that time HTML tables became obsolete and a lot of web developers were advocating for web standards. And as a good practice, I started learning web development the right way, divs and css instead of tables in inline styles.
In my career I never had to do HTML emails and when clients asked me to make nice HTML email templates - I either outsourced it or directed them to one of the marketplaces to pick pre-made template and then changed a few thing here and there.</description>
