      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve built simple Rails application. Then I decided to move it to &amp;ldquo;interwebs&amp;rdquo; and make it live. But&amp;hellip; it wasnt&amp;rsquo; as straigtforward as I thought. Even though there are gazilion tutorials - it just didn&amp;rsquo;t work. After about work of struggle - finally I figured it out. Here is step by step instruction that worked for me, I borrowed different steps from different tutorials. My stack is Linux, Nginx, Passenger, Ruby 2, Rails 4, MySQL, Node.</description>

      <description>Recently I started learning ruby on rails. And unlike other languages everything happens mostly in terminal, so next thing I know - I have to use command line now. I tried few tutorials here and there but couldn&amp;rsquo;t find anything that explained how to properly install ruby and rails step by step, something for ruby beginners. So, I wrote my process here. I&amp;rsquo;m using mac and ruby 1.8.7 is pre-installed with Mac OS 10.</description>
