Only very recently (about 1.5 years) switched from Windows PC to Mac – now I can say for sure, it was the right choice. Having iMac (and also macbook pro) I never ran into issues with a virus, blue screen or freezing on start up or any other similar problems, of course the computer becomes slower and slower as you use it, but after I switched to SSD this problem disappeared.</p>\n<p>Another reason I think mac is better choice for me is because there is bigger choice for web development editors and especially git support. I started using git only few months ago (only because one of the clients required it) – I understood why there is so much buzz around it, It simply awesome. Having version control for any project now is a must for me. SourceTree app is working the best in my opinion no matter if you use github or bitbucket or any other git / mercurial based service.</p>\n<p>I was a big fan of Coda since I switched to Mac and was waiting their updates impatiantly – and bought Coda2 almost few hours after it became available on App Store. It was a disappointment – not what I was expecting at all. So, after some research I switched to Sublime Text 2. Using it for few weeks now I think it’s pretty good (not perfect though). Another great tools I use everyday for <a href="http://alexbachuk.com/portfolio/%20%5C%22Portfolio%5C%22">web development</a> are <a href="http://livereload.com/">live reload</a> and <a href="http://incident57.com/codekit/">codekit</a>.\\n\\nSo currently my workflow is – working locally then commit and push to git repo and then update files on FTP. Comparing to my workflow in the past – it looks like I do some extra work, but in the long run I have my code backed up all the time (not only to dropbox) and I can safely hack things without worrying about what happens after I hit “cmd + s”. Working a lot with WordPress I immediately ran into a dilemma – database. How do I get me database synced. Fortunately there is a free tool like Sequel Pro – fast and easy database management app.</p>\n<p>Now it’s time to connect git to my server to eliminate that extra FTP step. Any suggestions where to look?“,</p>',frontmatter:{title:"My working set up and workflow",date:"May 21, 2012"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/blog/my-working-set-up-and-workflow/"}}}});
