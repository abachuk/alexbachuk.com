      <description>Uploading files is one of the most common tasks performed by web developers. It’s a pretty simple operation when using PHP or other server side frameworks. However, it is not so straightforward when using Node.js, unless you understand how to user Buffer API for reading streams of binary files (i.e. uploading file content as binary code). Luckily for us, the Node.js community came up with a few solutions.
Project set up We are using React.</description>

      <description>Mobile web is growing really fast and for some businesses it is a significant (if not majority) amount of traffic. The experience on mobile could be slightly different than desktop or it could be completely different depending on the project or the app. For example, marketing or news website might have similar experience, since its only goal is to deliver the content in accessible way. But, for other websites, like e-commerce mobile experience might be have totally different meaning.</description>

      <description>It’s not very easy to upload files directly to Meteor, although there is a way to “emulate” file system and upload files directly to your server, why not use Amazon S3, which very cheap and fast to host static files. I find that having the separation gives some peace of mind, you can deploy your app, change servers, even delete the app or re-build it from the ground up, without affecting your or users&amp;rsquo; static files such as images, videos, documents, etc.</description>

      <description>I had a chance to attend one of the Angular.js meetups. Google hosts the meetup in its New York Chelsea market office. This time it was a hack night, few googlers were there, some other smart people. We broke into few groups and were discussing various things (protractor.js, mean stack, node.js and angular bugs in general).
I was surprised how many people were interested in MEAN (MongoDB, Express.js, Angular.js, Node.js) stack, which is full stack written 100% in JavaScript.</description>

      <description>Recently I wrote a blog post about deploying meteor.js application to Digital Ocean server. It works, but after few deploys I found it&amp;rsquo;s not the most efficient way to deploy the app. You have to SSH to server every time and transfer the files (overwriting old ones), you alredy can see the problem here :)
After some googling around, I found awesome npm module called &amp;ldquo;mup&amp;rdquo;, stands for meteor up.</description>

      <description>Meteor is a full stack framework on top of node.js. It has different conventions than regular node.js application. Meteor uses smart packages and doesn&amp;rsquo;t have main bootstrap file where everything is configured. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t provide an option to conditionally load assets such as stylesheets or JavaScript files depending on controller or route. I was facing a challenge where I had to separate marketing website from main application.
The goal The end goal is to be able to deploy Meteor application to digital ocean server and ability to access it from sub-domain like so app.</description>
