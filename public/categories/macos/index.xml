      <description>Recently I started learning ruby on rails. And unlike other languages everything happens mostly in terminal, so next thing I know - I have to use command line now. I tried few tutorials here and there but couldn&amp;rsquo;t find anything that explained how to properly install ruby and rails step by step, something for ruby beginners. So, I wrote my process here. I&amp;rsquo;m using mac and ruby 1.8.7 is pre-installed with Mac OS 10.</description>

      <description>After upgrading to Monutain Lion - Java wasn&amp;rsquo;t working in web browsers by default. Apple switched to software updates in App Store.
So to install / update Java, open terminal and type
/Applications/Utilities/Java Preferences.app/Contents/MacOS/Java Preferences  You should see dialog box with install button
Don&amp;rsquo;t forget to restart the browser.</description>
