### The seven mindsets of success are:

1. Be positive, not hokey.
2. Aim for the stars – have high expectations.
3. Believe in yourself or no one else will.
4. Learn and grow.
5. Be brave – accelerate your career.
6. Stay the course while others fall.
7. Be ruthless, selectively.

### Time management

1. Set clear goals. This month, week, today.
2. Keep a todo list. Convert goals into small actions.
3. Make it simple. Break down the goals
4. Short interval scheduling. 30min- hour blocks
5. Take breaks, rest.
6. Finish projects ahead of deadlines (52/48)
7. Do it once, do it right
8. Say no to time wasting meetings and requests
9. Review how you spend your time (logs). Noise vs signal.

# Ideas

### You need a compelling idea of the future for five reasons:

1. To raise your ceiling of success
2. To gain control over your business or unit
3. To create a clear sense of priorities: what you will and will not do
4. To give hope and purpose to your team
5. To demonstrate you are making a difference

> The best leaders separate the noise from the signal very well

You have to communicate and sell the idea to your team, bosses and peers. And you have to know how to make the idea work alongside the formal strategy of your workplace, which means navigating the world of strategy comfortably.

> Leaders make things happen through other people

If you want to lead, you have to make a difference. You need an idea that others will notice and remember.

As a leader, you have to deal with the day-to-day battles but never lose sight of the greater goal you want to achieve.

But as a leader, you have to do more than just manage. Instead of sustaining a legacy from the past, you have to create a legacy for the future. That puts change at the heart of leadership.

> Leadership is about taking people where they would not have got by themselves

As a manager, it is enough to control the existing business. As a leader, you have to take the business somewhere different and better.

## Your Ideas matter

Will a boss two levels up from me notice what I am doing? Do colleagues in other departments think I am making a difference? How will I remember this year in ten years’ time?

The team expects a leader to give clarity, hope and purpose to their work.

In a world of endless ambiguity, we need to create as much clarity as we can. If we have no agenda, no idea, then we have no clarity or control. Your agenda is your first step towards gaining some control.

Once you have a clear agenda, you start to gain control. You have a basis on which to say no to work that is not important and you can start to focus time and effort on those things that matter most.

> The difference between pressure and stress is control – if we have to achieve a goal but we are in control of our destiny, then we can rise to the challenge

Control means setting the direction, building the team and then empowering and supporting the team to achieve that goal.

Control is the difference between leading and drifting

Once you have a clear idea about how you want to make a difference, you can set your agenda and take control

Dare to dream, then dare to act

Your ambition is defined by your idea. If your idea is to reduce the use of paper clips in your office, you will succeed more or less against that goal. If your ambition is to set up a new business, you raise your ceiling of success greatly.

Your success is limited by your ambition. You are unlikely to achieve more than you plan for.

In a world of endless ambiguity, we need to create as much clarity as we can. If we have no agenda, no idea, then we have no clarity or control. Your agenda is your first step towards gaining some control.

People expect a leader to give clarity, hope and purpose to their work.

**You are making a difference if you can answer the questions:**

- Will a boss two levels up from me notice what I am doing?
- Do colleagues in other departments think I am making a difference?
- How will I remember this year in ten years’ time?

## Craft your idea

You need to do more than react to events – you have to shape events to your ends.

As a leader, your starting point is to imagine your future perfect. As an exercise, imagine how you want your team, your world and your role to look in three to five years’ time?

Once you know your future perfect, you can start working back from there. Instead of first things first, start at the end. If you don’t know where you are going, you are unlikely to get there. Work out how to achieve the big things first, then slowly work into more detail after that. By separating out the important from the less important, it becomes a very useful time management tool. Do less important stuff less and less.

## Communicate your future perfect idea

Successful communication comes down to three elements:

- One simple and consistent message
- Constant repetition
- Multiple methods of communicating

A good idea creates clarity and helps people at all levels make better decisions.

Ultimately, leadership is an engagement sport. You cannot lead by remote control. As John le Carré wrote: ‘A desk is a dangerous place from which to view the world.’ This is as true of leaders as it is of spies.

You need to create a team and a network of people who have faith in your story. Clearly, your top team needs to buy in. If they do not buy in, they need to move on. A team that is playing against itself is unlikely to succeed.

Less obviously, you need to engage a specific network of individuals across your organization. You need to get the informal grapevine of the organization working for you. Relying on broadband media to get your message across is not enough.

## Plan your idea

The key to a great story is also the key to a great plan. Just like a journalist, you need to answer the basic questions: what, why, when, who and how.

- What? What is your objective?
- Why? Why is this relevant, and to who?
- When? Your goal should be time limited – when do you expect to finish?
- Who? Who do you need on your team?
- How? What are the big risks and issues you need to deal with, and how will you deal with them?

It is not enough to have an idea – you have to have the discipline to define it clearly and work through the consequences.

## Sell your idea

If you want to lead, you have to sell. The more you advance as a leader, the more of a salesperson you become. You will find that you are having to sell your ideas, your vision, your priorities and your solutions to your team, your colleagues, bosses and stakeholders within and beyond the firm. It pays to know how to sell your ideas.

There are three keys to selling your idea:

1. Listen.
2. Prepare and question.
3. Know your idea.

> the secret of all great leaders and great sales people: you need two ears and one mouth. And you need to use them in that proportion. Listen at least twice as much as you talk.

As you evaluate your idea, there are two questions you should ask yourself:

1. What’s the problem?
2. What’s the prize?

Fortunately, you do not need to be a great orator like Pericles, Churchill or Martin Luther King. All you need to be able to do is tell a story, and we can all do that. It should be a simple story, in three parts:

1. This is where we are and why we must change.
2. This is where we are going and what it means for you.
3. This is how we will get there and how you can help us get there.

## Strategy

Many brilliant businesses are built by copying someone else. If you are irritated or annoyed by something, you can remain irritated and annoyed if you want. Or you can solve the problem and make a fortune.

See the world through your customer’s eyes, not through the warped lens of customer research.

> The difference between success and failure is persistence. The more you keep trying, the more you learn about what works and what does not work.

Read reactions carefully as people tend to be polite, so a neutral reaction is negative. When your potential customers start showing enthusiasm for your idea, then you have an idea that might work. The enthusiasts will describe why they like the idea in a way that will allow you to frame your value proposition or message to them credibly and persuasively.

# People

The best leaders have the best teams. The art of building and leading your team includes picking, recruiting, coaching and motivating your team and managing their performance. These are core skills every leader must learn.

## Manager's role

The more senior you become, the more ambiguous your role becomes. As a leader, you need to know where you add value to your team, where you make a difference. If someone in your team can do what you are doing, let them do it. Don’t work beneath your grade: you don’t have the time and you cost too much. This means moving out of your comfort zone of working with familiar challenges.

- Idea: Know what you want to achieve.
- People: Build and manage the team to deliver your idea.
- Action: Create the conditions in which your team can thrive

> As a leader, one of your key roles is to create the conditions in which your team can succeed.

That means picking the right team, securing the right budget and resources, ensuring top management support for your agenda, running political interference where necessary, dividing up and delegating tasks, and managing performance. These are things that only you as the leader can do – more or less everything else, your team can do for you.

## Attract the right people

You can teach skills but you cannot teach values. In principle, you will succeed more often if you hire to values, not to skills. When you are recruiting, you are selling.

By listening to them, you can start to understand what drives them, what they want as the next steps in their career, what is frustrating them now, what they like and dislike.

## Motivate your team

Stress, low self-esteem, depression and other mental dysfunctions are at epidemic levels.

Instead of focusing on performance based pay and bonuses. Focus on the intrinsic rewards, recognition and value of the job, creating a sense of community and belonging. This can achieve exceptional results at exceptionally low cost.

Some leaders use the fear part of the equation most. Fear-based leaders stress the negative: ‘If you don’t … or ‘You can’t afford to get this wrong.’ In the short term, this can be highly effective. Eventually, however, people burn out, stress out and walk out. Meanwhile, the fear-based leader has achieved results and may well have moved onwards and upwards to greater things. They climb to the top over the career corpses of those they have destroyed.

Finally, as a leader, you can use idleness to your advantage in two ways. First, do not make life difficult for your followers. Be clear about what you want, where you are going and how your team can get there. Give structure and guidance to your team to minimise wasted effort. Help your team by removing political obstacles and aligning other parts of the organisation with what they are trying to achieve. Set your team up for success. Second, do not interfere with your team. Do not over-manage. Delegate and give discretion within a structure. By making it easy for your team, you make it easy for yourself. Letting go is a hard but vital art to learn.

One popular form of good leadership is ‘MBWA’, or Management By Walking Around. Arguably, the opposite of MBWA is required: Management By Walking Away. For a leader, this is nerve-racking – you direct a team to do something and you want to see how it is doing. You want to pull up the seed every few moments to see how it is progressing. Leave it alone. Be available for help, but do not interfere. The end result may not be exactly what you predicted – it may be better. By not interfering, you show you trust the team, they feel motivated, they do their best and they learn more by trying to do things themselves than by blindly following your exact orders

Work on people’s hopes. Work on people’s fears – humane leaders seek to remove risk and remove fear while inhumane leaders happily stoke up fear. Finally, put idleness to work. Make things easy for others: give a clear structure and direction. Make it easy for yourself: do not over-manage. Fear, greed and idleness work as much for selling ideas as they do for motivating people. If your idea appeals to someone’s hopes and removes a fear, and you make it easy for them to say ‘yes’, they are likely to say ‘yes’.

HOW TO MOTIVATE YOUR TEAM:

1. Show you care for each member of the team, and for their career
   Invest time to understand their hopes, fears and dreams. Casual time by the coffee machine, not a formal meeting in an office, is the best way to get to know your team members.
2. Say thank you
   We all crave recognition – we want to know that we are doing something worthwhile and we are doing it well. Make your praise real, for real achievement. And make it specific. Avoid the synthetic one-minute manager praise (‘Gee, you typed that email really well’).
   Never demean a team member
   If you have any criticism, keep it private and make it constructive. Don’t scold your team members like schoolchildren. Treat them as partners and work together to find a way forward.
3. Delegate well
   Delegate meaningful work that will stretch and develop your team member. Yes, there is routine rubbish to be delegated, but delegate some of the interesting stuff as well. Be clear and consistent about your expectations.
4. Have a clear vision
   Show where your team is going and how each team member can help you all get there. Have a clear vision for each team member, know where they are going and how they can develop their careers.
5. Trust your team
   Do not micro-manage them. Have the courage to implement MBWA: Management By Walking Away.
6. Be honest
   That means having difficult, but constructive, conversations with struggling team members. Don’t hide or shade the truth. Honesty builds trust and respect.
7. Set clear expectations
   Be very clear about promotion prospects, bonuses and the required outcome of each piece of work. Assume you will be misunderstood: people hear what they want to hear. So make it simple and repeat it often and be consistent.
8. Over-communicate
   You have two ears and one mouth: use them in that proportion. Listen twice as much as you speak. Then you will find out what is really going on and what drives your team members, and you can act accordingly.
9. Don’t try to be friends
   It is more important to be respected than liked: trust endures while popularity is fickle and leads to weak compromises. If your team members trust and respect you, they will want to work for you.

This is what people expected from a boss:

- My boss shows an interest in me and my career.
- I trust my boss: (s)he is honest with me.
- I know where we are going and how to get there.
- I am doing a worthwhile job.
- I am recognised for my contribution.

As a follower, if your boss is clearly not interested in your career, it is unnerving and demotivating. You realise that you are no more than a disposable pawn in their career. Why would you trust a boss who has no interest in your career?

Dishonesty is not about lying, it is about failing to tell the whole truth, even the uncomfortable truth, promptly.

> I KNOW WHERE WE ARE GOING AND HOW TO GET THERE Sometimes this is called ‘vision’.

Provide a simple description of where your team has to get to on the next three-month project. Let your people know what they need to develop personally over the next six months and the practical actions they can take to develop those skills. Show where your business is going over the next one to three years. Do these things and you start to give people the clarity, structure and direction they need. Put it the other way: if your people do not know where they are going or how they are going to get there, they are soon going to become very frustrated.

You must be careful what you say because your team will hear what they want to hear. When you say, ‘I hope/intend/will try to get you your promotion/bonus/improved budget’, your team will hear you say, ‘I will … Your vague promise of help will be taken as a firm commitment to deliver. If you don’t deliver, your excuses will fall on deaf ears. Delivering on expectations means you must manage expectations well.

The leader is not there to solve every problem. You have assembled a team to solve the problems for you. You may have the most expertise, but avoid the temptation solve all your team's problems yourself. You need to raise your game and focus on the wider issues facing the team – making sure they are working on the right problem, making sure you have the right team, making sure they have the right support and development. Only if you force them to solve the problem themselves will they develop the skills and confidence to become effective.

> When the staff member comes into the office with a monkey, give them advice and coaching on how to deal with the monkey. This is neither quick nor easy. It will take careful questioning to understand their problem and to help them understand it properly as well. It is probably easier in the short term to deal with the problem yourself, to take the monkey off their backs. But make sure they deal with the monkey themselves. If you are really smart, invite them to take away one of your own monkeys as well. It could be a good development opportunity for them. By the end of the day, you will have succeeded if there are no more screaming monkeys in your room.

If you solve all their problems for them, they will never learn or develop as individuals. Neither will they have any ownership over your solution; they will lack commitment and belief. Coaching them through their problem helps them learn and develop and it ensures that they have ownership of whatever solution they eventually discover. As they become more adept at solving problems themselves, so they will rely less on coming to you for help. In the short term, coaching is high effort, but it pays big, long-term dividends.

## Delegation

As a worker, there is a limit to how productive we can be, however long we are in the office or however efficient we are.

But as a leader, there is no limit to how productive you can be. You can deliver far more than 24 working hours in a day. If you build the right team, they can collectively deliver thousands of hours of work every day. Your job is not to do all the work yourself, it is to make sure that your team can accomplish what needs to be done. That means you need the right team, and you need to delegate to the team.

The art of delegation has two parts: what you should delegate and how you should delegate.

You cannot delegate appraisals, negotiating budgets, hiring and firing the right team. You should also expect to run political interference and to protect and promote your team as necessary.

> don’t delegate the blame when things go wrong

When delegating, consider the following:

- What? What is the goal? How will we know when we have succeeded?When?
- When and how often do you require an update to check on progress? What are the key milestones and checkpoints that will let us know we are on track?
- Why? Why is this important and to who? Give your team some context so they can understand the challenge and its priorities.
- Who? Who are the team members and what are their roles?How? How will we go about doing this? How will we deal with the major challenges and trade-offs we face? Let your team raise concerns and explore how to overcome them. Delegation should be a dialogue, not a command.

Check that your team understands what you want by paraphrasing back to you what you have asked for. Or when they start challenging you about what, how and why the task should be done.

## Coaching

The essence of coaching is to enable someone to work through a challenge, find a solution and act on it. When someone discovers their own solution, they are more committed to it, more likely to act on it and more likely to learn from it. For a leader who wants to avoid the monkey problem (above), coaching is a vital performance skill.

A coaching event can be reduced to the five Os:

- **Objectives**. Be clear about what you want to achieve. If you want someone to do something in a certain way, do not try to coach them into reading your mind: tell them. It pays to be clear about what the problem is that you are trying to solve. When you are presented with some symptoms of a problem, dig to find out the root causes of the problem rather than dealing with the symptoms alone. Dealing with symptoms rather than causes is as pointless as using spot remover to help a child with measles.
- **Overview**. Let your coachee lay out the situation as they see it. Even if it is a flawed perspective, they will want their voice to be heard and respected. Then encourage them to look at the same situation from the perspective of other players. If they are complaining about the behaviour of another department or individual, get them to explore what the situation looks like from the other person’s perspective. As you consider different perspectives, you will understand the problem better and you may well be encouraging them to feel their way towards some solutions.
- **Options**. Encourage the coachee to explore a range of options. You want to avoid the ‘my way or no way’ syndrome which often leads to conflict, not progress. Avoid discussions about who is right or wrong – that is to look to the past, not the future. Help them look to the future. Even if the future looks bleak, there are normally one or two things that anyone can do to make some progress and achieve some stability in an unstable position. Exploring options is about the art of the possible, not about what cannot be done. As the coachee explores different options, you will normally find that one emerges as the most sensible way forward. You may already have thought of the solution, but let the coachee discover it so that they own it.
- **Obstacles**. This is the reality check. Before agreeing to the course of action, ask a simple question: ‘What might stop this happening?’ You want to avoid having someone run off with great enthusiasm which is dashed by the first obstacle they encounter. Help them identify, prepare for and deal with these challenges in advance.
- **Outcomes**. Ask the coachee to summarise the outcomes of the session. They should summarise both what they have learned and what action they are going to take. The purpose of the summary is to check for understanding and to help fix the key points in the mind of both coachee and coach.

As a coach, your goal is not to give the answer but to help the other person hit upon the answer. They may even hit upon a better answer than the one you were thinking of in the first place.

> great leaders and great sales people: they all have two ears and one mouth, and they all use them in that proportion. The more you listen, the better you are likely to be doing.

Typically, you will have three goals for each coaching session:

1. Address immediate challenges for the coachee. You should let the coachee raise issues of immediate concern even if they are not directly relevant to the longer-term goal.
2. Review progress against the overall goal for the year.
3. Review what went well, and what went less well, since you last met them

## Manage performance

Performance management starts before the performance. You have to agree the nature of the performance before you can manage it. Be clear about the what, who, when, how and why of the performance. It should be a two-way conversation about expectations. You want certain outcomes in a set time for a set budget. You need to hear whether this is seen to be possible, what support you may need to provide and what is expected in return.

Formal systems are there to be gamed, and an informal contract is about trust. If you game the informal contract, you break trust. This is why you need to take time to make sure that the psychological contract is both fair and agreed. If you simply dictate it, it will be seen as another set of requirements which can be gamed if necessary.

_"At least once a day I would dig the flower out of its earth and check on its progress. I would then cover it up again and put some more organic fertiliser (manure) on it. Needless to say, it never grew. This is how some leaders performance manage: they are always checking on their team and then dumping some management manure on them. Then they wonder why the team fails."_

the more you interfere, the more you create extra work. Each time you ask for an update, the team is going to spend time preparing the update and reacting to any words of wisdom you may have imparted to them. Each time you ask a question, that may generate more work, and each time you make a suggestion that also generates more work. More control means less trust, lower morale and more work for the team.

Always ask WHY you succeeded or failed to learn and grow. Learn why you succeed, and you can do more of the same. Use debriefs to help the team to learn and grow.

Don't just track the performance - manage it.

## Difficult people

Ineffective leaders complain about awkward peer groups. Effective leaders find ways of working with even the most awkward peer group.

Characteristics of awkward people:

- Victims. "Poor me", "it's not fair" type that feel powerless.
- Villains. Competitive politicians who undermine peers, spread blame and claim credit.
- Control freaks. Telling what to do and always right.
- Indecisive. Waiting for perfect, risk-free answers. Go missing when you need them.
- Incompetents. Can talk but can't do anything.

When confronting these people, be clear why you're having the discussion and what actions need to happen.

Initially, explain why you need to move forward. Then push the problem back on to the awkward squad member – ask them what options and alternatives they see. Try to create options rather than a take-it-or-leave-it choice which becomes a win/lose discussion.

Focus on the task, not on the behaviour. You are a leader, not a personal psychologist.

> Ultimately, you should aim to be a role model as well – behave as you would have others behave to you and behave in a way that commands respect in the organization. In most workplaces, you will not advance by role modeling the behavior of the awkward squad.

**When the conflict arises:**

- Visualise the end of the event: Where do you want to be? Focus on that.
- Win a friend, not an argument
- Let the other side vent: Let them dump their emotion, let them be heard
- Stay positive and constructive: You will be remembered more for how you behaved
- Leave a good impression
- Imagine what your favourite role model would do in this situation, then do the same thing

**Firing people**

Ultimately, your responsibility is to your organisation: the survival of the organisation takes precedence over the survival of the individual. Having the wrong person in the wrong place puts many other jobs at risk. You have to make the difficult decision and change people who are not in the right post.

# Make it happen

To make things happen you have 3 priorities:

1. **Be very clear about your goals and priorities**: Know what you want to achieve. If you do not know what you want, you are unlikely to find it. Goal focus lets you separate out the noise of day-to-day management from the signal. Deal with the noise, but create time to make progress towards your goal.
2. **Find help**: You cannot do it all alone, so build a team that will help you succeed. Build a network of influence and support across your organization that will also help you.
3. **Master your craft**: This is where you can personally make a difference – and they are the things all leaders deal with.

As a leader, in addition to technical skills, you need to master three more sorts of skills:

1. **Organisational skills**: As a leader, you have to know how to lead change, make projects work, control costs, deal with budgets, handle crises and conflicts, and make and influence decisions in uncertainty.
2. **Personal skills**: You meet, talk and listen to people, and read and write papers, you may be understood. That is the mundane reality of what leaders actually do all day, but some are very good at it and others are not. Hone these daily skills and you will stand out from your peers.
3. **Mindset skills**: The best leaders act differently because they think differently.

> Leadership is about taking people where they would not have got by themselves. That means that change is at the heart of leadership

A leader will make a difference by changing how things work and moving towards a new future perfect.

So if you want to make real change, you will face real resistance. This alters the definition of leadership from ‘taking people where they would not have got by themselves’ to ‘taking people where they do not want to go (to start with)’. Change also means changing the organisation – changes in the pecking order mean that change is also a highly political process.

The less control over the change I have, the more I am likely to fear it. So change is dominated by the **FUD** factor: FEAR, UNCERTAINTY, DOUBT

People, CEO, senior leaders, who are in full control don't fear the change, because they control it.

**Formula for change:**

`Vision + Need + Capacity to change + First steps ≥ Risks and Costs of change`

As a leader, it pays to work the whole agenda. Constantly remind people of the vision and relate it to their needs. Build up the need to change and the risks of doing nothing.

The greater the perceived risk, the greater the resistance to change. Make the change very low risk and no one will get in your way.

The art of leadership can be thought of as a series of linked projects which help people go where they would not have got to by themselves.

For most leaders, project management is a vital art to master if you are to make things happen. And if you do hire help to manage your project, you need to know enough to make sure they are doing their job well.

Good project management is the hallmark of a good manager. The manager delivers against preordained goals with preordained resources. Good change management is the hallmark of the good leader. The leader goes beyond formal authority, using influencing and political skills effectively, to make things happen.

**Success depends on the 4 principles:**

- The right problem
- The right sponsor
- The right team
- The right process

Too many managers look where it is easy, not where it is useful. To be useful, we must look in the right area and solve the right problem, even when it is difficult.

In all cases, where we are trying to solve problems, repeatedly asking ‘why’ helps. Practice "chunking" until you get to the bottom of the REAL problem.

Always have an ally or a sponsor: The CEO is an ideal sponsor. The sponsor has to have enough authority and resources to enable the project to happen.

---

**Main Project management rules:**

1. **Start at the end and work backwards**. Define the end outcome as clearly as possible before the start so that everyone knows where they are heading. Knowing the destination minimizes the risks of deviations en route and cost escalations from contractors.
2. **Figure out the minimum number of steps required to get there.** If you know the end point, then figure out the minimum number of steps required to get there. By looking for the minimum number of steps, you will also be defining the critical path (which events need to happen before others can be started), which will also make it much easier to control and monitor progress.
3. **Create an effective governance process**. A good way to escalate costs and time is to have vague goals, change your mind frequently and make decisions slowly. This often happens where there is a political environment and not all the constituencies are truly aligned. Clear goals and clear decision-making processes are vital.

> A successful project which is invisible to top management does not help its leader much.

## Handling Conflicts

> The leader should be highly suspicious if there is no conflict, because organizations are set up for conflict.

Constructive conflict is a sign of a healthy team. It shows that instead of conformist groupthink, you have a team with different skills and views, and that your team is ready to challenge each other and you – where required. Lack of conflict implies you have a team of conformist yes-men who all think alike.

> Conflict is not about people or personalities, it is about positions and priorities.

Keep these principles in mind:

- **Never avoid conflict**: Embrace it. Conflict is how priorities are set and decisions are made. It develops the leadership and interpersonal skills of the emerging leader.
- **Depersonalise the conflict**: Never take conflict personally, even if it is meant that way. Focus on the issues and interests at stake, not the personalities.
- **Detach yourself**: Observe what is happening and do not get emotionally involved.

1. **E**mpathise.
2. **A**gree the problem.
3. **R**esolve the way forward.
4. “Win a friend, not an argument.”

## Handle crises

Most people find they do have a crisis at some point in their careers. It can feel very lonely. The only person who can get you out of the crisis is yourself. The middle of the organisation is where many emerging leaders find themselves bailing out to set up their vegan farm on a Scottish island. This is natural. The first flush of career enthusiasm has disappeared. The long haul to the top still looks long. Then something happens: the final straw is added to the camel’s back.

> ‘That which does not kill you, makes you stronger.’ - Nietzsche

1. Recognise the problem early rather than avoiding it.
2. Take control. Offer solutions, not complaints. Have a plan.
3. Act fast, avoid paralysis by analysis.
4. Focus on what you can do and do it. Don't waste your efforts on what you can't control.
5. Find support. It's not wise to solve all the problems by yourself.
6. Over communicate. Have a simple story to tell about where you are going and how you will get there. Be clear and consistent with your message. Dispel fear, uncertainty, doubt and confusion.
7. Be positive. People remember HOW you behaved more than WHAT you did to solve the problem. Set the standard for those around you.
8. Avoid blame. Give praise to those who help, don't point fingers at those who are at fault.
9. Show empathy.
10. Make the most of crises.

The best way to prepare for crises is to develop resilience early on. Fail early, fail often, fail fast. Analyze and learn with every failure.

## Negotiate budget and targets

`Success = Results - Expectations`

`Happiness = Reality - Expectations`

Naive managers often accept ‘challenging’ targets because it sounds macho to do so. In contrast, more experienced managers will set expectations low, which then makes it easy to beat the target.

The naive manager accepts a challenging target and delivers results that are better than the more experienced manager. **The crucial difference is that the experienced manager negotiates low expectations.**

If you are setting budgets, you want to set them low to make scarce resources go as far as possible. If you are receiving a budget, you want as much as possible so that you have the resources to support your goals.

> Essentially, budgets and targets are a negotiation. Treat them that way.

**How to negotiate**

1. **Strike early.** Set expectations very early, before the formal budget cycle starts. Early in the cycle there is plenty of room to maneuver.
2. **Tell a story.** And keep on telling it. You are the expert in your area; it takes time and effort for others to dig into your data and challenge you. Use this imbalance of knowledge to your advantage. Then keep on pushing your story and pushing your facts relentlessly.
3. **Understand the process.** Know when the budget cycle starts, who is involved and when the broad framework is decided. Make sure you influence the broad framework by making your case to the right people at the right time
4. Manage this year performance. If you worked minor miracles this year, next year you will have to work major miracles. When you realise this year is going to be outstanding, you might want to start massaging your numbers – bring expenses forward, delay recognising revenues. Create a baseline that is acceptable for next year.

> Don’t wait for the top-down process to work its way down to you – by then it is too late and your fate will have largely been settled.

## Control Costs

A quick way to fail as a leader is to fail to control your costs.

- shows you are not in control and you are no longer seen to be reliable
- surprises your bosses, who dislike surprises
- causes problems across the organization, which will have to make up for your shortfall.

> You cannot become an outstanding leader through cost control alone. But you cannot become a leader at all if you do not control costs well.

1. **Use the 52/48 rule**. Achieve 52% of results with 48% of resources.
2. Review your position frequently (at least once a month). If they behind, push them early. Frequent reviews send a message - budget and deadlines are taken seriously.
3. Act early. The longer you leave the problem, the worse it gets.

## Make decisions in uncertainty

The decision fog appears for various reasons:

- Uncertainty
- High stakes
- Politics
- Multiple perspectives
- Complexity

> You are the expert in your area and if you are not the expert, you should not be there.

Seek advice. As you seek advice, you build support for the way forward. When colleagues have been involved in making a decision, they are more likely to support than if you just present them with your solution. Don't take it too far. Do not let anyone else make the decision for you.

**Understand the problem**

In most cases, the question (or problem) is never stated or clearly defined and you have to work out what the question is. Once you know the who, what and why about the problem or opportunity, the solution often presents itself clearly.

> Who wants to address this problem/opportunity and why?

**Size the price**

Know what the desired outcome is. Evaluate each option in terms of that prize. Only after you know the potential benefits of each solution is it worth exploring the risks and issues of each solution.

**Avoid perfection**

> A good way of making sure that a decision is never made is to seek the perfect solution. It is better to seek the practical over the perfect.

It is better to work towards your goal in steps rather than hope for the perfect shot. Also avoid too much analysis. Analysis is often a smoke screen, which is used to avoid having to make a decision.

## Build your machine: the rhythms and routines of success

Your leadership machine has seven parts:

1. Project management
2. Strategic planning
3. Information management
4. Performance management
5. Development plans
6. Compensation and reward plans
7. Communications

As a leader, your role is not to operate the machine, but to build the machine and make sure it works the way you want it to work.

**Project management**

Make sure day-to-day is taken care of and spend your time on one or two initiatives where you intend to make a difference. When you have take direct control of a project, your job is to set your team up for success.

- Ensure that your team has the right goals, right resources and right support.
- Ensure that the right people are on the team
- Provide air cover for your team: politics, roadblocks, time wasters, distractions.
- Monitor progress without being a control freak.
- Keep delegating. Empower them and make them accountable.

**Strategic planning**

All leaders know when to follow the rules and when to break them. Formal planning process is an ideal opportunity to start breaking the rules. If you follow the formal process, you'll be cornered by people who in charge of the process.

Instead strike first, tell them what the goals should be. If you have a clear plan, you need to start selling it to the key influencers and decision-makers long before the planning process formally starts.

> Your goal is to make sure that top management gives the planners planning assumptions which meet your needs.

If you want assumptions that work for you, align your goals very closely with the goals and priorities of top management. If you are seen to be helping them on their big idea, then the support and cash will flow your way.

> Make sure you control the machine – do not let the machine control you.

> You cannot drive to the future by looking in the rear mirror all the time.

**Information management**

Here are the four types of information you need from your machine:

1.  Financial information
2.  Market information
3.  Operational information
4.  Information about the future

If you rely entirely on the machine, you become a prisoner of the machine. Reach beyond the machine to find the information you most need to lead.

Performance management

As a leader, the best performance management does not happen through the formal processes of the firm. Performance management happens day to day and in real time.

If you do the day-to-day performance management, then the formal system becomes record-keeping. You simply record what you have already discussed and agreed.

Development plans

Answer to this question the most likely answers the if a leader is good or bad (in employee's eyes).

> My boss cares for me and my career.

Showing that you care for the career of a team member goes far beyond talking about a development plan once a year. You have to understand what each person wants.

You are simply a stepping stone to something else: help them on their next step.

Compensation and reward plans

> Compensation does not make people happy, but can make them unhappy

Successful compensation management does not come from following the system blindly. It comes from managing expectations very well. Weak leaders will make half promises about compensation, rewards and promotion. If it didn't happen and your answer is "I tried, but..." your excuses will fall on deaf ears. You will have lost all credibility.

Do not shade the truth. It is better to have a difficult conversation early about expectations. It can be a productive conversation in which you jointly agree what the team member needs to do to achieve their bonus and promotion hopes.

**Communications**

> “We communicate more than ever, but we understand each other as little as ever.”

> Work and productivity are different concepts.

# Skills of success

What leaders do all day is talk to people, go to meetings, write emails, read reports. **Reading, writing, meeting** are the skills necessary for leader's success.

You can use time well by focusing on three questions:

- What do I want to achieve?
- How can I get others to help me?
- What is my role?

when you have a great team that does everything for you, that leaves you with a problem: what is your role and where do you add any value? Answer this and you will find you are highly productive. Normally, the things you have to do and cannot delegate include setting direction; picking, coaching and supporting your team; providing political cover when required and negotiating the right budgets and resourcing for your team.

Time strategy can be summed up as focus on the right goal, with the right team and with the right role for yourself. If you do all of this, you have a chance of being highly productive without being highly stressed.

Rules of time management:

1. **Set clear goals.** Know what you want to do this month, this week and today. Review your goals regularly and make sure you stay on track. Set your priorities accordingly.
2. **Keep a to-do list.** Convert your goals into actions for today. Then check and review at the end of the day. Make sure you are doing the high-priority and tough items, not just the easy and less important tasks.
3. **Make it simple.** Big tasks often look daunting, so it is natural to try to avoid them. But even the biggest task can be broken down into small, simple steps. Do this, then start tackling each simple step.
4. **Use short-interval scheduling.** Focus on what you can do in 30 minutes or an hour. Perhaps it is no more than making some important phone calls. Once you have done them, tick them off your to-do list and reward yourself with a tea or coffee.
5. **Rest.** No one can work well non-stop. You need short breaks, which will help your energy levels and concentration. Resting for five minutes an hour can help you have 55 productive minutes in an hour, instead of 60 unproductive minutes.
6. **Have your crisis early.** Living life close to every deadline may be exciting and look dynamic, but it wastes time – you are firefighting rather than progressing. Finish tasks well ahead of deadlines and you will stay in control and still be able to deal with any unexpected last-minute panics.
7. **Do it once, do it right.** Rework is a major source of wasted time and energy. Aim to touch each piece of paper and each email just once – deal with it and move on. Take the 3D approach to every email: **deal with it, delete it or delegate it**.
8. **Control your time.** Time thieves are everywhere, stealing your time with unimportant meetings at awkward times. Make sure you attend relevant meetings at convenient times and avoid the rest.
9. **Manage your environment.** If you live in chaos, your time will evaporate amid missing files and distractions on your desk.
10. **Question and challenge.** Review how you spend your time. Keep a time log to see what you really do, how much time is spent reacting to noise, is wasted or is proactively pushing your agenda. Adapt your habits accordingly.

**There are three ingenious ways of losing time:**

1. Procrastination. It's the illusion of work. Use to-do list to keep you in-check
2. Distractions. Social media, unnecessary tasks, mindless browsing - cut it off.
3. Multi-tasking. We cannot concentrate on more than one thing at a time.

## Presentations and public speaking

An audience is more likely to remember you than your message. In many ways, you are the message.

3 Rules of public speaking:

1. Energy
2. Enthusiasm
3. Excitement
4. Expertise (bonus)
5. Enjoyment (bonus)

Some suggestions to prepare:

- **Throw away the script**. If you practice too much you sound robotic and monotone. Instead, memorize your opening so that you can make a good start. Memorize your conclusion so that you can make a good finish. Memorize some choice phrases that you want to insert on your way through.
- **Avoid complicated slide presentations**: If you have slides, the principle is to have dumb slides but a smart presenter. The slide might have three or four key words to help the audience anchor where you are – you provide the commentary. Don't just read "smart" slides that explain everything.
- Keep the posture.
- Engage the audience. Talk to people in the audience, keep eye contact.
- **Vary your pace and pitch**: Dare to slow down when you come to an important point. Give your key points the space to be heard.
- **Keep it simple**: Focus on one or two messages at most. If you have a large audience, focus on the one or two key executives you want to influence. This will let you focus your message, get rid of excess material and tell a simple story.

## Meetings

Effective meetings come down to three principles:

- Right **purpose**
- Right **people**
- Right **process**

**Ask yourself**

- What do I want to learn?
- What will I contribute?
- What happens next?

If the senior people cannot master the detail, they should not be there. They probably should not be senior managers.

Hesitation is a product of starting late. It is nearly mandatory for senior people to turn up last or late. This shows that they are very busy and their time is more important than yours, so you can wait.

Paraphrase the speaker to check you have heard what they are saying – this shows them that you are listening and they may shut up. If they raise the same point, repeat the paraphrase

## Writing

- Write for the reader.
- Tell a story.
- Keep it simple and short.
- Make it positive in substance and in style.
- Support assertions with facts.

The good writer thinks themselves into the position of the reader and writes for that person. When this happens, clarity and focus are achieved. You can drop much of what you could write and focus on what the other person needs to read. Avoid the trap of writing for yourself.

The story should pass the elevator test: you can summarise it to your boss in a fast-moving elevator going a short distance. The virtue of telling a story is that it helps cut out all the noise that will confuse the message.

Think of all the communications you receive every day – you really remember the headlines, not the detail. Focus first on getting the headline right, then marshal the minimum required to back up theheadline.

Writing short is much harder than writing long. It requires real mental discipline.

Another thing that helps the reader is to keep words and sentences short. Jargon, fancy words and complicated sentences impress the writer more than the reader. Documents, like diamonds, benefit from good cutting. Your document is not complete when you can write no more, it is complete when you can write no less.

People prefer to hear about opportunities and solutions rather than problems and difficulties. Be positive and sound positive.

## Reading

In managerial terms, it pays to read with prejudice and with an agenda:

- Know your point of view.
- Know what you expect to be covered.
- Have some coaching points ready.

it is better to read a little well than a lot poorly.

## Work with numbers

Managers use statistics the same way drunks use lampposts – for support, not illumination.

# Next Level

Leaders no longer command all the people and resources they need to succeed.

- As a leader, you cannot demand loyalty, you have to earn it
- People have more choice. You have to rely on influence and persuasion
- Globalization
- Success is built on influence, persuasion, trust and occasionally fighting battles

**As a leader you don't have a job security at one company. Instead you have to:**

- Manage your own career as you move from one firm to the next, or set up your own
- Learn and refresh your core skills to stay relevant
- Replace command and control skills with an ability to influence, persuade and build networks of influence and trust.
- Replace deep technical skills, which become dated or are replaced with artificial intelligence (AI), with people and political skills.
- Be comfortable with ambiguity, change and challenge, which neither technology nor traditional managers cope with well
- Learn how to lead highly skilled professionals who do not want to be managed.

## Lead professionals

> As a leader, you do not need to be the smartest person in the room: your job is to get the smartest people in the room.

If you do your job well you will be leading people who are as smart, if not smarter, than you are. You no longer have to lead workers – you have to lead professionals.

Leadership moves from command and control to collaboration and commitment.

Many professionals do not have a high respect for their managers. They think that managers generally get in the way of them doing a good job and they could do your job far better than you can.

10 ways to manage professionals:

1. **Stretch them**: Professionals are natural over-achievers. Let them over-achieve, learn and grow. An idle professional is a dangerous professional.
2. **Stretch them**: Professionals are natural over-achievers. Let them over-achieve, learn and grow. An idle professional is a dangerous professional.
3. **Shield your team**: Focus your team on where they can make a difference. Shield them from the politics, routine rubbish and noise of corporate life. They may even be grateful to you if you do this well.
4. **Support your team**: Set the team up for success with the right resources, right support and right goals.
5. **Show you care**: Invest time in each team member – understand their needs and expectations. Help them on their career journey.
6. **No surprises**: Don’t surprise your team at appraisal time: all trust will be lost. Have difficult performance conversations early so they can change course.
7. **Recognize them**: Professionals have pride. Feed their egos, praise good work in public. Never, never demean them in public. Have the hard conversations in private.

9. **Set expectations**: Some professionals want it all and want it now. Some want more and sooner. Any hint about bonus and promotion will be taken as a 100% firm promise. Be clear and consistent in your messaging.

## Manage your boss (manage up)

If you want to be effective, you have to manage your boss well – they have the power to make life good or bad for you. They are the most important person in your career, and you know it.

There are three main principles to work on:

- Adapt your style.
- Build trust.
- Have a plan B.

Ultimately, you have to take responsibility for your career. You either have to adapt to your boss or find a boss you can work with. Complaining about your boss is therapeutic but ineffective.

## Build influence across your organization

Management is about making things happen, most of the time through people you do not control.

**Tools to build your influence:**

1. Clear and relevant agenda. If people don't know what you want, they'll ignore you. Relevance also matters. Relevance in this case begs the question: who is my agenda relevant to? Clear agenda is helpful in few ways:
   1. gives you visibility beyond your own unit
   2. enables you to decide which battles to fight and which to avoid
   3. tells you who you need to influence and bring on board
   4. helps you focus on your real priorities
2. build trust with people who matter. `trust = (credibility x intimacy) / risk;`

**Risk**

Many ideas are killed not because they are bad ideas but because they are seen to be risky. So remove the risk – ask approval for just the first phase, then demonstrate it is not risky with reference to similar ideas that have succeeded. Remove the personal and political risk by showing that the idea has the support of other key people.

**Intimacy**

Intimacy is about showing that you have the same values, interests or needs as the person you are with. This means it is worth taking time to research people before you meet them. You should be able to find something you have in common.

> Small talk or chit chat to an opportunity find common ground and shared experience.

The need for intimacy is the enemy of diversity. We trust people like ourselves, because we assume that we know how they think. If you come from a different background to the people you work with, you have to work hard to establish the bonds of common interest.

The more you listen, the more you learn. The act of listening is a form of flattery – we are always pleased when someone else appears interested in our triumphs and travails, however trivial they may be.

**Credibility**

Credibility is about doing as you say. In the popular jargon, you have to ‘walk the talk’.

> If something is important, make it happen. When you accept excuses, you accept failure.

Another problem can be what we say and what is heard are often very different. People hear what they want to hear, so take care in what you say.

> As a leader, it is our job to make sure we are not misunderstood.

We have to communicate clearly and set expectations clearly. If in doubt, set expectations low. This is a trick we have all learned when dealing with bosses: under-promise and over-deliver. Credibility is like a vase: when you break it, it is very hard to put back together.

**Popularity**

Leadership is not a popularity contest, outside politics. Instead of making hard and unpopular decisions, the popular leader seeks an easy way out. Even worse, weak leaders make promises to attract support. When these promises cannot be delivered, trust plummets.

## Influence decisions

As a leader, you cannot make every decision yourself. Some decisions will be beyond your control.

1. **Anchor the debate on your terms**. Strike early and set the terms of the debate around your agenda. For example, is the moon more or less than 1 million miles from earth? I have no idea, but I have just anchored the debate around 1 million (not 10 million or 100,000).
2. **Build your coalition.** Manage disagreements in private. Once they disagree with you in public, they will be committed to that position and will not change. Meet key people early and in private. Let them change their view without loss of face and publicize any agreements widely to build a bandwagon of support. Find powerful sponsors to endorse your position.
3. **Build incremental agreement.** Don’t scare people by asking for everything at once. Ask individuals to back the one part of your idea where they have relevant expertise (finance, health and safety, etc.).
4. **Size the prize.** Build a clear, logical case which shows the benefits of your proposed course of action. Quantify the benefits and have them endorsed appropriately.
5. **Frame the decision favorably.** Align your agenda with the corporate agenda. Frame your idea in the right language and style for each person. Be relentlessly positive.
6. **Restrict choice.** Don’t give too many options that will tend to confuse. If you offer 30 choices, you create confusion and decision paralysis will follow. Offer two or three choices at most. This is normally option A: ideal, expensive and impractical; option B: cheap, nasty and unacceptable; option C: the one you want them to pick. Let them lecture you on how awful options A and B are, then look suitably impressed by their insight and advice when they tell you to go with option C.
7. **Work risk and loss aversion to your favor.** Show that alternatives to your idea are even riskier. Normally the default option is ‘do nothing’: low cost, low risk and low effort. You have to show that doing nothing is not acceptable.
8. **Put idleness to work.** Make it easy for people to agree, by removing any logistical or administrative hurdles for them.
9. Be persistent Repetition works.
10. **Adjust to each individual.** See the world through their eyes. Respect their needs in terms of substance, style and format. Build common cause. Align your agendas.

## Listen to influence

People like listening to the one person they truly trust and admire: themselves. Give people the chance and they will talk themselves into submission.

Example approaches:

- **Sales call**. Let them talk about their views and challenges, that will direct your questions and propositions.
- **The staff challeng**e. When your team brings the problem to you, rather than telling them what to do, ask questions and let them come up with the answer. It will give them more ownership and make them more independent.
- **The performance review**. Let the team member go through their performance, self evaluation. Ask them questions what they can do better.

Active listening:

- Paraphrase. Instead of interrupting or injecting your point of view, summarize in your own words what you heard the other person say.
- Ask open questions. The right open questions will get the other person to focus and reflect on the right issues the right way.
- Debrief. Every meeting should end with the debrief:
  - What did you hear/observe during the meeting?
  - How were they reacting?
  - Who does what next?

## Career

Our employment comes from our employability. We have to build and refresh the skills we require to sustain us over a 50-year career.

As a leader, the reality of careering has profound implications for how you manage your career and skills:

- You have to keep refreshing your technical skills. Whatever you are good at today, someone else who is younger, cheaper and hungrier than you will do it differently and better in five years’ time. You have to run just to stay still.
- The skills you need to lead evolve over time. When you start your career, you succeed on the basis of your technical skills. Over time, these technical skills become relatively less important. Instead, you have to acquire deep capability in managing people and organizations. This means acquiring political skills of influencing decisions, aligning agendas, fighting or avoiding battles, and building networks of trust which help you get things done.

Claim to fame characteristics:

- It will be something you enjoy doing, because you only excel at what you enjoy. Excellence takes huge amounts of discretionary effort over many years. You can only sustain that effort if you enjoy what you do.
- Your claim will have visibility and resonance across and beyond your firm. Small achievements will not be noticed; deeply technical achievements are unlikely to be very useful elsewhere.
- You will own your claim to fame. Many people will have helped you, but you have to show that you were the leader of the initiative. If you do not shout about it, you will not be heard and others may decide to take the credit for what you did. Like gold prospectors in the Wild West, stake your claim or lose your claim.

## Success formula

**WWW (what went well). Learn from success.**

This is a simple question you should ask yourself after any key event, which might be a meeting, a presentation, a phone call or a document you crafted. The idea is to catch yourself succeeding, and to then keep on repeating that formula until you find something even better.

So when something works well, stop to think why it went well and what you did to make it go well. It might be obvious things like spending more time on preparation. Or it might be very small things like offering some small talk and a little flattery before starting the substance of your meeting. Whatever it is you do that works, do more of it.

> Always debrief (with yourself)

**EBI (even better if).** EBI is your second debrief tool.

Even better is to learn what you can do differently next time. When things did not go so well, EBI is an action-focused way of not beating up yourself or your team with ‘what went wrong’. It invites positive ideas on how to improve.

Try to use both EBI and WWW: they work together and can be used in the same way. Use it to debrief yourself or your team, to debrief an event, a day or a week. The point is to keep on learning what works for you and for your team. And you have to keep on learning and keep on changing because your context keeps on changing. What worked five years ago will not work today in a new role and possibly in a new firm.

## Step up

Your success will not be defined by sending emails and attending meetings. Your routine is just that: it is routine. But success is not routine, it is exceptional.

It's challenging to show performance because a lot of responsibilities are shared and the work is increasingly ambiguous.

> You will be judged by a few exceptional moments where you are visible and where you can shape the future.

Some opportunities to show your performance and be ready when promotion time happens:

- **Presentations**: Long after people have forgotten what you said, they will remember what you were like. If that is all they have seen of you, that will frame how they think of you. This is your moment in the spotlight. Invest as much time as required in making sure that you shine.
- Delivering. On time and on budget.
- Building your team: You are only as good as your team. Weak leaders recruit weak teams who, in the words of one boss, would not ‘outshine me, outsmart me or outwit me’. Recruit the best team you can. Look for three things: Quality, Fit, Balance.
- **Crises.** It is the moment leaders step up and followers step back. Stepping back and offering analysis is safe, because it does not commit you to anything. But in a crisis, you need action not analysis. Fortunately, many crises are predictable because you know what can go wrong in your area. By taking control you make yourself the leader, and you can shine. **Crises are great opportunities if you are prepared.**
- Setbacks: A crisis is driven by external forces, while a setback is your responsibility. We all have setbacks and how we deal with them shapes our future. Some people give up and seek a quieter life elsewhere, which is legitimate but not leadership. To lead, you need resilience. Best is to acknowledge the problem and take control: drive to action and fix it. Leave the post mortem to later, or never.
- **New ideas**. New ideas mean change and risk. This leaves a vacuum: who will scope out a new idea and become its champion? First mover advantage is huge. If you are the person to do the initial scoping, you will probably be the person to lead the planning and lead the implementation. If the idea is a big idea, you will find yourself leading at a very high level very fast. Think big, strike early.
- **Starting a new role or new project**: Most battles are won or lost before the first shot is fired: the side which is better prepared and in a better position usually wins. The same is true when starting on a new project or role. Make sure you have set yourself up for success with the right goals, right resources, right budget and right team before you start. The moment you formally commit, you lose all your negotiating power.
- **Receiving feedback**: No one likes feedback, unless it is praise and flattery. Equally, managers dislike giving feedback, because most managers dislike confrontation especially with their own team. If you argue about the feedback, you are the manager’s worst nightmare. You appear disloyal, confrontational, unable to learn or improve and impossible to control. You will be at the top of the list when it comes to restructuring and downsizing. This is a good time to be inquisitive, positive and constructive. Your boss will breathe a huge sigh of relief and want to keep you on the team.
- **Awarding promotions and bonuses**: This is where you are tested as a leader: can you deliver on the expectations of your team?
- **Seeking promotion**: In the past, seniority systems meant you could wait your turn for promotion. That does not work any more. If you want promotion, you have to seek it out, either within or beyond your current firm. If you get rebuffed, that is your chance to ask what it will take to get promoted in future. Remove the guesswork and agree a clear road map to success. If you don’t ask the question, you don’t get the answer. Be bold and ask.

Leadership is a performance. If you are going to act the part, it pays to know what your role requires. The universal requirements of leaders can be thought of as professional guard, the minimum you must deliver at all times as a leader.

**Developing professional guard**

Professional guard is not just about setting standards for yourself – it is about being a role model for others. It also makes it easier for others to deal with you – you do not want them distracted by your behavior or appearance. Set your own higher standards by following the Golden Rule: treat others as you would be treated.

If your colleagues dress poorly or gossip and bad mouth other colleagues, you do not have to follow their example. By setting a higher standard, you can stand out in a positive way.

Learn your part, adapt to the company. See what works for you. When a great leader joins a lousy organization, it is the reputation of the organization that remains intact.

The best leaders not only act differently, they think differently. Continuing leadership research is showing that the way the best leaders think is consistent.

**The best leaders share the same mindsets:**

1. Aim for the stars – the power of high expectations.
2. Be brave and accelerate your career.
3. Stay the course while others fall by the wayside.
4. Stay positive, not hokey.
5. Believe in yourself, or no one else will.
6. Learn and grow.
7. Be ruthless, selectively.

the best leaders stay like this every day for years and take each mindset to an extreme.

> Respect, not popularity, is the currency of leadership.

Examples of good unreasonable leadership

1. Set stretching goals. Force business not as usual. Take people beyond their comfort zone so that they can grow and develop. Focus on impact.
2. Do not micro-manage professionals. Believe in your team. Let them come up with a better approach than the one you first thought of. If they want help and guidance, let them ask for it and then provide it.
3. Do not settle for second best – look beyond skills to find people with the right values and commitment.
4. Set up your team for success – give them the right budget, give them air cover from politics, interference and administrative grief, ask them what they need and make sure they get it. Pre-empt any excuses.
5. Be precise about your goals. Specify in detail what good looks like, be clear on timings and milestones. Avoid any vagueness or ambiguity, and check your team understands your expectations. No surprises.
6. Do not solve all their problems for them. Help them learn to step up to each challenge by coaching them, not instructing them.
7. Trust your team and they will respond. Do not over-monitor. Review progress early on so that you can take corrective action in time and coach as needed. Break large tasks into bite-sized chunks that can be achieved, monitored and delivered.
8. When you accept excuses, you accept failure. But be generous in your praise and do not hog the limelight. Give recognition. Motivate your team.
9. Setbacks are an excuse to work better and more creatively, not for delay or scaling back ambitions. Create an open culture where setbacks are recognized early, and you learn from them and drive to action fast. Avoid the blame game.
10. Avoid analysis paralysis. Be clear about what happens next and do it now.

> Leadership is not about your title, it is about what you do

Ultimately, they all have the same agenda: the IPA agenda of Idea, People, Action. If you have a good idea about how you want to build a future perfect firm or unit, you have made a good start. A good idea gives you an agenda, which starts to give you control over your destiny, rather than being shaped by external forces. Then surround yourself with a great team and help them turn the idea into action.

Let yourself enjoy your leadership journey. You only excel at what you enjoy. Only when you enjoy what you do can you sustain the effort required to succeed over many months and years.
