Every company, startup or business is a collection of projects. A project is a panned, logical unit of work with some expected outcome that contributes to an overall vision or strategy. It’s how we organize work, tasks, and even personal lives. Everyone should understand how to manage projects to some extent. Especially if you are in a leadership position.

We’ll review some techniques to plan and organize projects, set them up for success and measure their success along the way.

## Every leader is a project manager

I haven’t seen many companies where they have a Project manager as someone’s official title. Product managers, technical program managers, engineering managers don’t want to be associated with project management because it’s not what they do. In reality, any leader is responsible for their team’s projects or projects they are leading. Leaders are project managers.

Engineering managers have multiple roles and responsibilities. We are planning technical roadmaps, hiring engineers, coach and grow our team. And we are ultimately responsible for our team’s projects. Engineering managers should be able to organize and drive projects to success. Most of the time, you’ll have to work closely with your product managers, business managers, and program managers or scrum masters. Since your team is responsible for the execution, be prepared to take full ownership and accountability of the project output.

> For a project to succeed you need to identify the right problem, sponsor, team, and process.

## Priciples

### 1. Understand the project

As a leader of your team, you have some control over the projects you’re committing to. Before taking on any project you have to understand:

- **Why** do we need to work on this project and why now? How this project contributes to the bigger mission or goal? How the output fits in our long term roadmap?
- **Who** are the stakeholders, sponsors, and customers? What expectations they have, concerns and problems they try to solve with this project.
- **What** are the scope, expected outcomes, and output? Start at the end, understand how success looks like to you and the stakeholders? Clearly articulate the definition of “done".
- **When** do we start and finish the project? Is there a desired timeline for the entire project or specific milestones? Is it a hard deadline, meaning we can’t miss it no matter what. If it is then we need to understand why it’s the case, could be legal consequences, could be scheduled public announcement. If the marketing team just came up with some random date then the deadline is negotiable.

### 2. Frameworks

There are multiple frameworks to organize a project, keep track of the progress, inform the stakeholders, identify blockers, etc.

- **[RACI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsibility_assignment_matrix)**. Stands for “Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, Informed”. Know who your stakeholders, sponsors, and customers are.
- **[5 Project phases](https://project-management.com/top-5-project-management-phases/)**. Project Initiation, Planning, Execution, Tracking, Post mortem, and reporting.
- **[Agile](https://agilemanifesto.org/)**. Use prioritized backlog, execution is organized in sprints, deliver changes or features frequently.

Know these frameworks and understand how they are helping your team, stakeholders and you to organize, estimate and deliver projects and manage expectations. Being organized and knowing all details about the project’s current status is critical for engineering managers. The most critical time is before the project has started. It’s the easiest time to influence the project outputs, great planning is important for project success. This includes identifying the risks and communicate them early on to keep the surprises to a minimum.

### 3. Motivate the team

If planning is a shared effort, the execution is ultimately your team’s responsibility. They will architect it, code it, fix bugs, and will be maintaining the project for a long time.

They should be excited to work on it. Otherwise, it will be another boring task they have to work on. Now, your responsibility as a leader is to “sell” the project to the team and get them excited, get their buy-in and support. When your team understands “why” this project exists, they can better understand the level of impact on the overall vision or strategy. They should see the connection between the project and the whole business.

Once they understand this part, they should come up with “how” to do it, this gives them full ownership of the architecture and execution plan. You need to trust them and rely on them to get it done properly and on-time.

Create a culture of ownership and accountability, give them leverage to make decisions and push back on product and business if there is a disagreement. Only by being a stakeholder or partner in the project, someone is truly motivated to get it done. If it’s a top-down command, the motivation won’t be as strong if at all. Trust your team and be available to support them if and when needed.

### 4. Assign the right people

Depending on your team’s structure, you will be responsible to assign a few people to a specific project. Most companies practicing agile have some sort of crew structure, where a team of developers is organized in smaller units (crews) around specific projects to stay focused for a period of time or until the project is completed.

Some managers make a mistake to assign their strongest engineers to critical or high profile projects. This may work for some and for some time. By doing that you’re burning out the strong engineers and not creating an opportunity for others to grow. Instead, consider putting more thought into who should be working on a specific project. Every project is an opportunity for engineers to learn, explore areas where they haven’t worked, mentor others and show some leadership. Pairing up strong engineers and less experienced creates a good balance and opportunities for all.

### 5. Kick-off

Any successful project has to start with a proper kick-off meeting. Usually, it’s driven by a product manager. It’s yours and the team’s opportunity to ask clarifying questions and get on the same page what success looks like, the scope, timeline, milestones and challenge some of the decisions made. It’s also a great opportunity to put everything you agree on in the writing, in the form of a project one-page document. One-pagers are a great way to have a centralized source of truth about what the project is and isn’t. It’s a living document, so if any decisions affecting the project are made, changes to the scope or timeline, the document should reflect that.

### 6. Prioritized backlog

After you have a one-pager, the next thing is the backlog. Your team (including you) should work with the PM to finalize the milestones and create specific tasks (stories or tickets). Each story should be estimated, there are different methods: t-shirt size, Fibonacci method, numeric scale, etc. The goal of this exercise is to have an organized and prioritized backlog of estimated tasks. Your backlog is the execution plan that can be tracked and measured at any point in time.

Prioritization is important to focus on the most important stories first, the features that provide the most benefit to your customers or business shouldn’t be delayed.

### 7. Architecture is part of the project.

As soon as a feature or project codebase is merged it becomes a legacy code and eventually a technical debt. Not all technical debt is bad, but having too much of it can be deadly to your product. Just like with financial debt, you have to pay interests. Too much debt and your finances are struggling because all you do is paying off your interests and not the principal.

As an engineering manager, it’s your duty to know how much debt you have and strive to minimize it all the time. Use every project, business initiative, product objective as an opportunity to improve the health of your software. This means every single project has to have a portion of the architecture and refactoring. It may not be easy to convince your business and product stakeholders on the importance of it. That’s why constantly educating how technical debt accumulates and affects the software is important.

In the business and corporate world, everyone has their own agenda. Business wants to grow sales and revenue, get more supply. The product wants to get more customers, improve conversion rates, get the product to be more useful, add new features. Engineering wants software quality, stability, performance, security, and maintainability.

Since engineering managers represent technology in this triad, you should keep pushing your agenda and make sure there is a balance between business, product, technology, and process. And don’t forget technology is supporting business and products. Technology for the sake of technology won’t make any difference. Don’t just chase the new shiny frameworks, make sure there is a real benefit to the business.

It’s much easier to latch on the existing business and product goals and add the technical things you need to address, rather than asking to take time to refactor your code. The latter indicates you haven’t been doing a good job constantly improving your product. It’s like you need to go to a doctor because you haven’t been exercising regularly. Exercise your body and your codebase regularly :)

### 8. Know the status and context.

Engineering managers are in constant communication with different people in the company. Anyone at any time may ask what’s the status of a specific project. On another hand, if you encounter someone in a meeting or random conversation and they may be a blocker for your team’s project success. You should know where all of your projects are at any given point in time. It won’t be easy especially when your team is bigger than 8-10 people. Knowing the status and details of all your projects gives you the advantage of pro-actively resolve the blockers before they arise. It could be in the form of talking or convincing some stakeholders, getting a piece of infrastructure set up for testing or securing QA engineers for testing in advance before they get too busy. The smaller your team, the more details you should know about your projects. For bigger teams, you should rely on tech leads for details and know the executive summary on a weekly basis.

### 9. Negotiate flexibility.

As I mentioned earlier, any successful project consists of the right problem, team, sponsor, and process. Another way to think about a project’s success is expectations. To translate it into an algorithm it looks like this: `success = results - expectations`. Any creative agency working with clients will tell you, underpromise and over-deliver. It’s no different in this case. You have to manage expectations all the time, before planning and during the project execution. Always underpromise and communicate the risks. If you overpromise or just simply commit to a project with a deadline that your team finds difficult to achieve, you’re putting a lot of stress on your team to deliver. That’s how teams end up working on nights and weekends. Because managers fail to negotiate and manage expectations. In most organizations deadlines and budgets are negotiable. It’s your job to negotiate reasonable goals with some breathing room to work on unexpected things and for your engineers to be able to learn and experiment without fear of missing a deadline or failing the project completely. When you’re communicating your concerns or just negotiating, remember that listening doesn’t mean hearing. People may be distracted when you’re trying to communicate. Make sure to repeat your message until you know people hear you and understand you. You should deliver your message using different channels: in-person, slack, comments on wiki page or tasks, etc.

### 10. Measure success

Before measuring the progress and success, first, you need to know what success looks like. When planning a project, start at the end. Understand what success looks like. If you don’t know what it looks like it will be hard to tell when you get there (or won’t get there). Just like eating an elephant, one bite at the time, projects can’t and shouldn’t be executed as a whole. Every project, even a small one, should be broken down into reasonably small sub-projects (milestones) and then further down to tasks (to-do lists). We covered the process in the “Prioritized backlog” section. By using this process and visualizing the status of each task and milestone you can see the status of the entire project. If your project’s stories, in total, have 200 estimated points. 50 of them are closed, 50 in work in progress and 100 are open. You can measure the status.

1. % complete / schedule, are you hitting your baseline dates
2. Quality (peer review, testing, etc)
3. Budget / cost / team headcount
4. External dependencies/stakeholders expectations
5. Project outcome (performance or impact of this project on business) vs output (what is produced when project is finished). Outcome!== output

### 11. Conflict resolution

Leaders often driving change. The change could have many different forms, from total tech migration to refactoring, to changing the culture, to re-organization, etc. There is always a chance. We use projects to get to the end state.

### 12. Retrospective

You can’t improve if you don’t measure. Retrospectives are your opportunities to look back, collect the feedback and use for future improvements. They can be done after each project or a few times during the project execution. Depending on your team and the project.
Everyone on the team shares what went well and what we can improve regarding the process and the project itself. The feedback is recorded in the shared wiki for future reference.

## Summary.

An engineering manager wears many hats. One of their core responsibilities is to create an environment for their teams to succeed. And success usually means delivering the projects. Being able to plan, organize and rive projects is important for any engineering manager.
