Technical interviewing is all over the place. Some people claim it's completely broken and we might as well just pull a random names out of the pile. But it hasn't changed in a long time. Majority of the companies are still use white board to test candidates' knowledge of common and not so common algorithms, data structures and brain teasers.

For a lot of cadidates it's a terifying experience. It can be humiliating and discouraging, and even depressing. Especially for those who are just out of school or haven't been interviewing for a long time. I have been on both sides. In my career I've conducted over 500 interviews and interviewed at top tech companies as well as startups.

I want to share my thoughts for candidates to better prepare for interviews. If you're not prepared you have less chance to showcase your real expertise.

### Data structures and algorithms

This one is the most criticized part of the interview process. Is it really important to know how to reverse a linked list or [decode an alien dictionary](https://leetcode.com/problems/alien-dictionary) in order to be a productive software engineer? Most people will agree, the answer is "no". Why do the companies still asking these questions, then?

The answer is problem solving. The nature of software engineering is to solve ambiguous and hard problems. Although most engineers rarely have to use fancy algorithms to solve these problems. Knowing common algorithms and data structures make you a better problem solver. The more problems you solve the more you can connect them and build mental patterns.

Interviewers only have 45 minutes to assess your knowledge and make a decision if you will be an effective contributor. It's not an easy task. The cost of making a mistake is high. That's why the interviewers choose more difficult challenges than real life.

If you can figure out [how to find the closest bikes](https://leetcode.com/problems/campus-bikes/), explain why you're using certain data structures, what the O(n) time and space complexity is, then chances are high you can figure out how query a database and return it as a JSON.

If you took the time to study and prepare, it's a good indicator you have a discipline and patience. Which you'll absolutely need to be an effective contributor and grow in the future.

I still think the more effective way to evaluate someone's skills is to either build a sall project or pair program in the real codebase on a new feature or debug an existing bug. But unfortunatelly, it's not realistic for many companies. It will take significantly more time and effort for interviewers, who absolutely are not big fans of doing the interviews in the first place. Interviewers are software engineers too, and they want to code. Every interview interrupts their schedule. In addition to actual interview they need to prepare, review your resume and thing what they should ask you. And then write down a detailed feedback after the interview, and sometimes have a meeting with other interviewers or hiring committee if there is a diagreement on the final decision.

### Fundamentals

Learn data structures, not just for your interviews. It will make you a better programmer. The most common data structures are: Arrays, Dictionaries, Linked lists, Trees, Stacks and Queues. Your programming language has them. Just like having more than a hammer in your toolbox, knowing these datastrucrtures gives you an option to use the right one for the job.

### Don't get doscouraged

Almost everyone has failed tech interviews. It can be a humiliating experience. If you fail, use it as learning experience to identify your weaknesses and practice more. You'll start seeing patterns and cross reference different problems you've solved in the past. Remember knowing how to build software doesn't translate directly to successful interviews.

Interivew is a sales pitch, you're trying to convince an employer you're capable of solving complex problems. And hopefully an employer is selling their company as a great place to work. It shouldn't be a one way conversation. If a company is asking ridiculous questions and not treating you well, perhaps it's not the place you want work for.

Don't forget it's a conversation. If you're stuck, be honest what you know and what you don't know. Ask for help, or syntax. Collaboration is one of the qualities they will evaluate you on. If you're asking the right questions, generally moving in the right direction, it's ok to ask for some hints and bounce some ideas back and forth. It's impossible to know everything.

Interviewing is an acquired skill. The more you do it the better you get as an interviewee and software engineer. It's like a sport or public speaking. You can memorize all you want, but as soon as your name is called and the spotlight is on you - you forget almost everthing. That's why practicing is important. Start small. Ask your friend to interview you, use services like pramp, interview.io, and others. Simlate the environment as close to real interview as possible.

Good luck!
