From book
**When the conflict arises:**
- Visualise the end of the event: Where do you want to be? Focus on that.
- Win a friend, not an argument
- Let the other side vent: Let them dump their emotion, let them be heard
- Stay positive and constructive: You will be remembered more for how you behaved
- Leave a good impression
- Imagine what your favourite role model would do in this situation, then do the same thing

## Handling Conflicts

> The leader should be highly suspicious if there is no conflict, because organizations are set up for conflict.
Constructive conflict is a sign of a healthy team. It shows that instead of conformist groupthink, you have a team with different skills and views, and that your team is ready to challenge each other and you – where required. Lack of conflict implies you have a team of conformist yes-men who all think alike.

> Conflict is not about people or personalities, it is about positions and priorities.

Keep these principles in mind:

- **Never avoid conflict**: Embrace it. Conflict is how priorities are set and decisions are made. It develops the leadership and interpersonal skills of the emerging leader.
- **Depersonalise the conflict**: Never take conflict personally, even if it is meant that way. Focus on the issues and interests at stake, not the personalities.
- **Detach yourself**: Observe what is happening and do not get emotionally involved.

1. **Empathise.
2. **Agree on the problem.
3. **Resolve the way forward.
4. “Win a friend, not an argument.”


From the training:
Sample conversation starters
1. I would like to talk about ___ with you but first I'd like to get your point of view.
2. I think we have different perception about ___ I would like to hear your thoughts on this.
3. I think we may have adifferent ideas about ___, I want to talk about it.
4. I would like to see if we might reach a better understanding about ___, I really want to hear your feelings about this and share my perspective as well.

- Focus on common ground: avoid who's right or wrong, define what you agree on
- Identify the type of conflict (process, personal, status)
- Focus on future (the resolution) rather than the past (who did what)
