<!--
Make sure your manager knows your goals
Understand the expectations
IDentify the gaps
Build a roadmap
Agree on milestones and check ins
Ask for feedback
 -->

Getting promoted at work is not straight forward and can vary from company to company. Most, not all, want to get promoted from time to time. Not everyone understands how to get promoted, they get frustraigted. Don't expect to just close JIRA tickets and magically get promoted because you've worked in the same place for few years.

First, you need to have a goal. If you want to get promoted to senior software engineer within a year or two, then set it as a goal and work backwards.

Understand why you want to get promoted. Different people have different reasons. It could be either financial, status or recognition or combination of all 3.

Take on responsibilities first, show you're capable. Then promotion will come automatically.

Discuss your goal with your manager. Your manager should be your supporter. Work together to agree on the target expectations. Your current performance should be the baseline. This way you both can develop a roadmap, how to get from point A (your current baseline) to point B (target promotion). The roadmap will consist of the gaps you need to address (skills, behaviours, leadership, influcen), some SMART goals and timeline (milestones, check ins).

<!-- NOT SURE: Double down on your stregths. Provide a unique value to your company, something that's hard to replace or take a long time to learn. It doesn't mean accumulate domain knowledge and hide it so it becomes your job security. It means -->

Don't wait until a perfect project falls in your lap or your manager serves the opportunity to shine. Instead it's your responsibility to show your ambitions and ask for opportunities or even create the opportunities.

It may not be easy, and almost impossible in some companies. Some managers could just be stright up assholes or simply incompetent. Don't leave your career to your manager or the company. You own your career. Blaming others won't work, it will make things even worse.

Not all companies have room to grow. Look around and see if your fishtank is big enough.

Ask for feedback. It's the fastest way to identify your blindspots, weaknesses and gaps. Keep in mind that people are not comfortable providing criticism directly in your face. Understand individuals' and teams' comfort zone and come up with creative way to get the valuable constructive criticism. Avoid asking questions like: "Can you give me some feedback?". It's pretty broad and you're throwing all the hard thinking to the other person. Instead ask very specific questions related to very specific events, interactions, codebase.

Some examples could be: <!-- come up with 5 very specific questions -->

- Specific questions in pull requests
- Pair programming
- Ask your manager for a specific feedback (presentation skills, specific interction with PM, etc).
- How do you think I handled the argument about moving the business logic into the separate microservice? I felt like Chris and Ben had some valid arguments, but the outcome in that meeting is disapointing to me...
