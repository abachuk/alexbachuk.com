Few days ago WordPress community celebrated 10 year anniversary. It's a huge milestone for an open source project and for its community, which is the driving power behind the project's success.

I started developing websites almost five years ago, and after 1 year of struggling with HTML, CSS and JavaScript - I decided to try different platforms to speed things up, first one was Joomla, then WordPress, then Drupal. WordPress definitely looked like the winner, I used version 2.8 at that time. It was very good experience - installing themes, installing plugins, editing content, modifying CSS, HTML. Everything was so "easy" comparing to writing everything from scratch or dealing with templates.

Time passed and now WordPress is the most popular content management system in the world, not only blogging platform. [It powers over 17 percent of top 1 million websites](http://trends.builtwith.com/cms) and probably more than 17 percent of the rest of the websites. Now it's ecommerce platform (with plugins like WooCommerce or Cart66), social platform (BuddyPress, bbPress), custom web app platform (gravity forms, json api plugin) and pretty much anything you can imagine. I always like to think about WordPress as well written and maintained php software where you have same limitations as php programming language and MySQL database.  It's not perfect solution for every project, for example I really like Ruby on Rails for custom web applications and API design.

After using WordPress for some time I decided to contribute back to community and collaborate with folks who also develop, hack or just use WordPress on the regular basis - I organized [WordPress Meetup in Stamford](http://www.meetup.com/stamfordwp/), Connecticut. First few meetups we had meetings in local bars, then me and other developers like [Clint](http://clintonwarren.com/) and [Brian](http://casjam.com/) started giving presentations on topics ranging from beginner level to advanced developer level and related topics like SEO and security. I also like going to WordCamps (New York, Boston, Philly) - a lot of smart people and core developers who share latest tips and tricks.

Now I work as a front end developer primarily JavaScript, HTML5 and CSS3 and don't deal with WordPress at my day job, but I still working with WordPres exclusively for client projects and for my own projects. I see more and more interesting ways of using WordPress, not just content management, for example you can [build iphone or android app](http://alexbachuk.com/wordpress-and-phonegap-part-1/) using its API, allow contributors to create and edit content in your website (without going to WP dashboard), polls and user registration, memberships and premium (paid) content, etc.

I hope WordPress will keep growing and developers keep innovating by making more plugins, themes and contributing to the core - making it better and more popular.
