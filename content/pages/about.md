Currently, I'm working as a Software Engineeting Manager at LinkedIn. Where I lead an internal reporting and visualization team.

Before, I was a Senior Director of Technology at Priceline.com. Where I lead Rental Cars Services and Web UX teams. Using Java (Spring Boot), React.js, Node.js and GraphQL technologies.

In the past I was involved in few startups as well as building my own products on the side. I started and was the original organizer of the WordPress meetup group in Stamford CT for few years until I moved on completely to JavaScript and Node.js.
