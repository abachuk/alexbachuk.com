Currently, I'm working as a Director of Technology at Priceline.com. Where I lead Rental Cars Services and Web UX teams. Using Java (Spring Boot), React.js, Node.js and GraphQL technologies.

In the past I was involved in few startups as well as building my own products on the side. I started and was the original organizer of the WordPress meetup group in Stamford CT for few years until I moved on completely to JavaScript and Node.js.

These days I'm one of the organizers of GraphQL NYC and Meteor.js NYC meetup groups. I often attend or speak at various meetups in New York and Connecticut.
