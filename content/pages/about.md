Currently, I'm working as a Director of Front end development and Web UX at Priceline.com. I'm focused primariliy on maintaining and building React and Angular codebases on front end, Node.js and GraphQL on the server.

In the past I was involved in few startups as well as building my own products on the side. I started and was organizer of WordPress meetup group in Stamford CT for few years until I moved on completely to JavaScript and Node.js.

These days I'm one of the organizers of GraphQL NYC and Meteor.js NYC meetup groups. I often attend or speak at various meetups in New York and Connecticut.
