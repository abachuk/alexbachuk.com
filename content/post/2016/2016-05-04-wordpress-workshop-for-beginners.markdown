I'm running a WordPress workshop in Stamford Innovation Center (Stamford, CT) next Wednesday, May 11th. This class is for beginners who want to learn how set up and customize a website (personal or for business). It's a great opportunity for anyone who wants to launch their website or someone who is getting into web development as a career move or a hobby. By understanding the basics of WordPress you can create a website and keep updating it yourself.
