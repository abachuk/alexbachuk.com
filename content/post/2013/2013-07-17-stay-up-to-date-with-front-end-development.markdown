My day job is front end web developer. That means I write JavaScript, HTML and CSS every single day (in that order). Front end development is not about static html pages anymore and JavaScript is not just for animations. It's much more than that. You can build any web application with these open source technologies, including on the server side (Node.js).

In this space web browsers are the ones who dictate how we, as developers, can utilize latest and greatest tricks, CSS3 animations and layout syntax (flexbox, columns), HTML5 APIs(localstorage, geolocation), JavaScript methods(map, pluck). Fortunately browser vendors are pushing really hard, competing for user share, they implement latest specs even experimental on monthly basis. That's why sometimes we need to use vendor prefixes (-webkit, -moz) and polyfills.

With this fast moving progress, it's hard for front end developers to stay current and keep track of all news in the industry. Google switched from webkit to blink, mozilla switched to rapid release cycle, opera switched from presto to webkit... and few weeks later to blink, turns out localStorage is few times slower than JS objects, jQuery 2.0 drops older IE support, which is better Backbone.js or Angular.js... or Ember.js? If you have to work all day - there is little time to read all the news out there and compare every single framework out there. But it's very important to stay up to date and discover new tools, to make the process of writing code easier and more fun.

I want to share few resources I use to make sure I'm on top of everything related to JavaScript and front end development.


## Podcasts


I like to listen to podcasts while driving or doing work that doesn't require any thinking.



	
  * [Shop Talk Show](http://shoptalkshow.com/)

	
  * [JavaScript Jabber](http://javascriptjabber.com/)

	
  * [Big Web Show](http://5by5.tv/bigwebshow)




## Blogs


Reading blogs, tutorials is the most important part of developing new skills or discovering new tools. I used to save all my favorite blogs in google reader, now it's gone, so  I just saved few bookmarks and visit these sites few times a week. I also follow some people on twitter, and if there is something interesting - it's definitely going to come up in my [twitter feed](https://twitter.com/netxm).

## Newsletters


Newsletters have become a good source for me lately as they do a pretty good job at summarizing the important news and tutorials.



	
  * [JavaScript Weekly](http://javascriptweekly.com/)

	
  * [HMTL5 Weekly](http://html5weekly.com/)

	
  * [WPMail](http://wpmail.me/).me (for WordPress news)




##  YouTube


There are tons of videos on youtube, mostly video of conferences talks. Google dev. team is doing great job to educate developers about latest chrome features and chrome dev. tools. Here are some of the channels I subscribe to:



	
  * [Google Developers](http://www.youtube.com/user/GoogleDevelopers)

	
  * [Marakana](http://www.youtube.com/user/MarakanaTechTV) (videos from major conferences)

	
  * [jQuery channel](http://www.youtube.com/user/jquery)




##  Meetups and conferences


If you ever have a chance to go to a conference - do it. It's amazing what you can learn, plus you get to meet a lot of cool people and hear about frameworks they created (Backbone.js, jQuery, Yeoman, etc...) I've been to few WordCamps, jQuery conference and going to Backbone conference in few days.

The best way to learn something is to teach. That's why I like to do presentations once in awhile at local meetups (I'm terrible at presenting, but practice is a good thing). I did presentations on topics like jQuery mobile, phonegap, responsive design, version control and git, a lot of WordPress presentations as I used to be the only organizer of the meetup and had to do a lot of stuff myself. Now [Clint](http://clintonwarren.com/) is helping me with that.

I always try to discover new technologies, tools, news, tutorials, blogs. So, if you have something to share - please leave a comment!
