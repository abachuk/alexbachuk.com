**[Recently I saw this question on Quora](https://www.quora.com/What-web-development-language-should-I-learn-in-2017)**:

>"I used to develop in PHP/MySQL about 4 years back. I understand that PHP is no longer a good choice. I would like to get back in developing dynamic websites/web apps again. What language/framework do you suggest I should learn which will also be useful in coming years? Thank you."

**My answer is below**:

There are many languages you can use for web development. PHP is still relevant, popular frameworks like [Laravel][c48b01b9] and [WordPress][d5db26f0] use PHP as an example. [Slack is using PHP](https://slack.engineering/taking-php-seriously-cf7a60065329) to power their back end.

  [c48b01b9]: https://laravel.com "Laravel is a PHP framework"
  [d5db26f0]: https://wordpress.org "WordPress is the most popular CMS in the world"

If you just want to learn a new language I would recommend to decide what you’ll be doing and start by answering these questions:

1. Am I focused on the back end or front end?
2. Do I need something really low level for performance or something easier to learn and get things done fast?
3. Am I looking for enterprise level language or something I can use to build proof of concepts and small websites?
4. Am I planning to do machine learning or build robust APIs?
5. Is there a specific industry or company I’m targeting?

Having a **focus and very specific goal** helps a lot when deciding where to invest your time.

If you’re not sure about any of the above - **learn JavaScript**, it’s a language here to stay. *Google, Apple, Mozilla, Microsoft, Facebook, PayPal, Netflix* and other tech giants invest in JavaScript heavily. Their team contribute to open source JavaScript frameworks and many of them are on [TC39 committee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECMAScript) (independent group that decides what new features are added to EcmaScript (scripting-language specification used by JavaScript). It’s a default language of all browsers and with [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) you can develop really fast and robust back-ends and APIs. With frameworks like ReactJS, Express, Next.js and Meteor - it’s possible to create any application that scales really well. JavaScript is being used by most if not all **Fortune 500** companies on the client (browser) side and server side (Node.js).

If you prefer something else I recommend learning [Go](https://golang.org/). It’s a low level programming language that supports concurrency and scales really well. [It was created by Google](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(programming_language)) and is perfect to build APIs and backends (it’s really fast).

Other languages I can recommend are:
 - Python for machine learning.
 - [GraphQL](http://graphql.org/) (not a language, but it’s worth learning for API development)
 - Java if you’re planning to work at bigger company with legacy code.
 - [Scala](https://www.scala-lang.org/) (runs on JVM)
 - C++ if you’re planning to do low level development.
