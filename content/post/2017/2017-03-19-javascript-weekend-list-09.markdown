It's been few weeks since I posted the last blog post. I was busy transitioning to my new job and enjoying the summertime with my family. But I finally feel like I recharged and have enough new material to write about.

Here is the summary of JavaScript updates and news this week


#### 1. Hacker News readers as Progressive Web Apps

Progressive web apps is an architecture designed to optimize web applications for performance. Using tools like service workers for offline mode, push notifications, background sync, etc. HNPWA is a new todo mvc but this time focused on performance and requirements that match real applications (API calls, navigation, sorting). Next.js HTTP2 with push, VueJS and others were added just recently (in addition to classic frameworks like React and Angular).


#### 2. Node.js Child Processes: Everything you need to know (by [_Samer Buna_](https://medium.freecodecamp.com/@samerbuna)_)._

Using multiple processes is the best way to scale a Node application. Node.js is designed for building distributed applications with many nodes. This is why it’s named Node. Scalability is baked into the platform and it’s not something you start thinking about later in the lifetime of an application.
